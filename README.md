# Self-dual bent sequences in Hadamard matrices

This repo is created for presenting various Hadamard matrices and corresponding numerical solutions of self-dual bent seuqnces. It is the open-source of the paper `Self-dual Hadamard bent sequences`, which is submitted to *IEEE Transactions on XXX*.

- [x] Special thanks to Patrick Solé and Dean Crnković for constructing and sharing those Hadamard matrices.
